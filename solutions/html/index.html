                        I can't believe it's been three decades at ACES already! I was among the first employees who joined the ACES branch in Abu Dhabi, and I feel particularly overwhelmed to have been both the first female engineer and the first chemist in ACES. I’ve had the incredible opportunity to grow in my career from a chemist to a Deputy Manager of ACES Abu Dhabi, which is a testament to the learning and career growth opportunities this company provides.
                        I had the privilege to witness and contribute to ACES’ growth and history and to enjoy a career journey where the visionary leadership, the company culture and values, and the commitment to high ethical standards have continuously inspired me. These principles have created an environment where not only I, but many others, have thrived.
                        Helping others grow and supporting colleagues has been one of the most rewarding parts of my time here. As I look to the future, I’m excited to see how our strong leadership team and the next generation of talents will shape the company's bright future
